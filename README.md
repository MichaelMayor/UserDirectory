## Description 
 
 
This project was created to demonstrate the method that one would create a user directory of employees using react. By taking random user profiles from Random User API, we can demonstrate how an employer could use a similar tehnology for their own employees. The project features a sort and search/filter bar for finding and highlighting specific profiles.
